to use openai's model you will need the openai api key , which you can get from here : https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. After getting your apikey keep it in the environment variables.
i.e create a .env file in the same folder and add your openai api key under the name OPENAI_API_KEY like this :

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-....."

then do as given in the main.py file.
